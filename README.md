2D RPG in Python

This is essentially a game engine using the Pygame library in Python, it is not a complete game.

A preview including most of the functions can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJXUZ-4kULU

Functions include dynamic menus, game saving, game loading, NPC interaction, moving map, various combat (sword, crossbow, fireball).

All code and artwork was created by me (Alex O'Hare), around early 2022.
